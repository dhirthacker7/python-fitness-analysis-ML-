## Key Features and Visualizations  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned and normalized fitness data to prepare for analysis.  
- Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.  

---

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Visualization:**  
Scatter plots, heatmaps, and histograms to identify patterns in health metrics such as heart rate, calories burned, and step counts.  

**Insights:**  
- Correlations between different fitness activities and overall health.  
- Identification of peak activity periods.  

---

### 3. Machine Learning Models  
- Built predictive models using Scikit-learn, including:  
  - Linear Regression for calories burned prediction.  
  - Decision Trees for classifying activity levels.  
  - Random Forest for multi-feature predictions.  

**Model Evaluation:**  
- Used metrics like RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and classification accuracy to evaluate model performance.  

---

### 4. Fitness Predictions  
- Predicted health metrics such as calories burned based on user activity.  
- Created an interactive system for inputting user data to receive personalized predictions.
